# Student Record Management System (CLI-Based CRUD)

## ðŸ“Œ Task Overview

This project is part of a Java Developer Internship assignment. The objective was to build a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** based **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system to manage student records using core Java concepts.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: VS Code / IntelliJ Community Edition
- **Data Structure**: ArrayList
- **Java Features**: Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Constructors, Getters/Setters

---

## ðŸ“š Project Structure

### ðŸ”¹ `Student.java`
- Contains the `Student` class with fields: `id`, `name`, and `marks`.
- Includes constructor, getter/setter methods, and a custom `toString()` for display.

### ðŸ”¹ `Main.java`
- CLI menu-driven application using a `Scanner` for input.
- Stores student records in an `ArrayList<Student>`.
- Features implemented:
  - Add Student (with duplicate ID check)
  - View Students
  - Update Student (by ID)
  - Delete Student (by ID)
  - Exit Program

## âœ… Features

- Prevents duplicate student entries (based on ID).
- Clean and interactive menu interface.
- Fully functional CRUD operations.
- Uses best practices like encapsulation and modular design.
